# concentration

this is the first assignment of cs193p, an ios application development course offered by Stanford University.

This assignment was for their fall 2017 iteration of the course.

I tried to follow the course material that they offered on youtube before my own coursework caught up with me, at which point
I stopped doing their course assignments. All I was able to complete was this assignment, and a couple of readings
on the swift programming language.
